- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dissakorn Plubpla, a third-year Robotics and AI engineering student at Chulalongkorn University.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data, Machine Learning, and Businesses
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Big Data and AI course which teaches how to process data and use it to create a machine learning model and I find this subject and its hands-on activity very fun. Just as the subject I completed earlier last semester "Database" teaches SQL type of Database and many more. So, even though I'm still new to this field, I can safely say that I enjoy it so much.
